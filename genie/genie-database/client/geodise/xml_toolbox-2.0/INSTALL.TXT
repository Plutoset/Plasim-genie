DOWNLOAD & INSTALLATION

Many thanks for your interest in the XML Toolbox for Matlab.

Quick Instructions:	

 + Fill in contact details on download page at http://www.geodise.org
 + Get file xml_toolbox-2.0.zip
 + Unpack the file with the password which will be sent to you by email

Detailed Instructions:

The XML Toolbox for Matlab is free of charge and can be downloaded from 
http://www.geodise.org. Please follow the links on the webpage to get to
the download page. Fill in the contact information required, then click 
on "submit" and obtain the xml_toolbox-2.0.zip file (size is approx. 12kB)
which contains all the necessary Matlab source files and documentation.

Unpack the downloaded zip file using a suitable software package (Linux 
unzip, Winzip, XP's built-in zip, etc.). This will create a folder called 
xml_toolbox-2.0. The installation instructions and documentation files 
should be immediately accessible. The other files are password protected.

The password will be sent automatically to the email address you have 
supplied on the download page. We will not use your information or email
for any other purpose than to send you the password and required information 
for maintaining the XML Toolbox. 
If you have problems obtaining the password or require further information, 
please send an email to gridem@soton.ac.uk with "xml toolbox" in the subject 
line. We will try to send you a reply as soon as possible.

Again, you are welcome to use the XML Toolbox for Matlab to your liking; 
it is free of charge, however, please be aware of the terms and conditions
as set out in the licence file LICENCE.TXT. 

When you have obtained the password, use it to unpack the remaining files 
in the xml_toolbox.zip archive. When the files are unpacked, add the new 
folder to your Matlab path. This is best done by typing the following line 
(replaced with your path) on the Matlab command prompt.

     addpath( 'c:/your/path/to/xml_toolbox-2.0' )

In addition you might want to add this line to your startup.m file in the 
matlab subdirectory of your home directory.

The following files should be present:
INSTALL.TXT       - this file, installation instructions
LICENCE.TXT       - software licence file - please read
xml_help.m        - displays information about the provided functions
xml_format.m      - converts a Matlab variable/structure into XML string
xml_parse.m       - converts a XML string back into Matlab variable/structure
xml_save.m        - saves a Matlab variable/structure in .xml file
xml_load.m        - loads the .xml file written with xml_save()
tests/xml_tests.m - performs a number of tests to verify that the functions work
matlab.xsd        - XML Schema for Matlab XML file validation
strsplit.m        - utility function which splits string at specified characters
doc/xml_matlab    - documentation of the XML Toolbox for Matlab

Testing:

Finally, type "xml_help" at the Matlab prompt. If the installation was succesful,
the help for the XML Toolbox functions should be displayed. Each function is 
easy to use and contains its own help section in the header (as is standard Matlab 
practice). To test, try to execute the following at the Matlab command prompt:

>> xml_format( 'Hello World!' )
>> 
>> str = xml_format(17.29)
>> a = xml_parse(str)
>> whos( 'a' )
