~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This version of the Geodise computational toolkit for Matlab provides a
Globus v2.x client from the Matlab environment. It has been designed to 
work with Matlab 6.5 (running within Java 1.3.1; "version -java"), the 
Java CoG 1.1alpha

The user should have a valid X509 certificate from a Certificate 
Authority acceptable to the managers of the Globus resources that the 
user wishes to access. To access Globus resources the user should submit 
the subject line of their certificate to the resource managers to allow 
them to map it to the user's account.

These installation instructions will describe how to setup the Java CoG, 
and how to install the Geodise computation toolkit in the Matlab 
environment.


1) Setting up the Java CoG.
	This creates a creates a cog.properties file containing the default 
	settings for the Java CoG, in a .globus directory in the user's 
	home directory. Once this process is complete the Java CoG command 
	line tools may be used.

	a) Create a .globus directory in the user's home directory

	b) Copy the example cog.properties file into the .globus directory, 
	and edit the values of the properties 'usercert', 'userkey', 'proxy'
	and 'cacert' to the correct values

	c) OPTIONAL: For performance the user may wish to change the random 
	seed algorithm, see the section II.3 of the Java CoG FAQ

2) Add the required Java Classes to the Matlab classpath.
	The Java classes which comprise the Java CoG, the Geodise toolkit 
	and additional required libraries must all be made available via 
	the Matlab classpath. This is set in the file classpath.txt in the 
	directory $MATLABROOT\toolbox\local\. However on a shared system 
	changes made to this file will effect all users, it may be better 
	to edit a copy of the original classpath.txt kept in the directory 
	from which Matlab is started. For more information see: http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/matlab_external/ch_java4.shtml

	The locations of the following jar files should be added to the 
	classpath.txt file:

	a) jar files distributed with the Java CoG 1.1a (in the \lib directory)	
		cog-jglobus.jar
		cog-lib.jar
		cog-tools.jar
		cryptix-asn1.jar
		cryptix.jar
		cryptix32.jar
		jaas.jar
		jce-jdk13-117.jar
		jgss.jar
		jndi.jar
		junit.jar
		ldap.jar
		ldapbp.jar
		log4j-1.2.7.jar
		puretls.jar

	b) jar file containing the Geodise computational toolkit classes
		gdcompute.jar
	
	e) OPTIONAL: Random seed algorithm if used, see section 1.d above
		InfiniteMonkey.jar 	

	It is necessary to restart Matlab for changes to the classpath to 
	take effect. 

3) Running the the Geodise computational toolkit for Matlab.
	Navigate to the directory containing the toolbox .m files and run 
	testScript.m to test the installation. The testScript.m should be 
	edited to add the name of a Globus compute resource which the user 
	is authorized to use. 

	There are three (no four) types of error which you may recieve;

	a) The toolbox is incorrectly installed. If you receive an error 
	such as;
      "??? Undefined variable 'org' or class 'org.geodise.computational."
	the Geodise computational toolkit classes, or any of the packages 
	which it requires is not visible to Matlab. Check that all the .jar 
	files listed above have been added to the Matlab classpath.

	b) The Java CoG is incorrectly configured. A correct cog.properties 
	file is required by the Java CoG to locate the user's certificate, 
	private key	and CA certificates.

	c) A failure to communicate with the Globus server. Unfortuately 
	there are numerous ways for Globus to fall over, typically the Java 
	CoG will return a more or less crypic Java error. I am trying to 
	identify and handle these errors within the Matlab code, if you have 
	such and error please send it to me and the problem may be handled 
	better in the next release. This webpage may help diagnose any 
	mysterious errors;
		http://www.globus.org/about/faq/errors.html
	
	d) A bug in the code. The testScript is designed to be flexible, but
	it may not be appropriate for configuration of your server, let me 
	know if you have a problem.
