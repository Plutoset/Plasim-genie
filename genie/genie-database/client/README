The GENIE data management system is a repository for files and associated metadata generated
by the GENIE framework. Data files produced by GENIE are archived to Grid enabled fileservers
and metadata about those files are stored in a database. Web services have been deployed that
provide an interface to the database. This client system enables an authenticated user to
query the database from a remote location and retrieve files of interest.

This product includes software developed by and/or derived from the Geodise project
(http://www.geodise.org/).
