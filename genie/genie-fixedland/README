***********************************

This module provides a fixed land-surface for use with other GENIE
components in the same way that genie-fixedatmos and genie-fixedocean
do for the atmosphere and ocean models.

The idea is that it has exactly the same I/O (argument list) as the
full genie-land module, but provides an unresponsive boundary
condition.  There will probably be 3 configurations of
genie-fixedland:

C1: "Do Nothing Land", which tries to replicate the old c-goldstein
land (LWout=LWin, LE=H=0, Tsurf=Tatm, Runoff=precip)

C2: "Do Something Land", which provides constant, uniform fluxes and
state variables.

C3: "Seasonal Land", which provides geographically varying monthly
mean fluxes and state variables.
