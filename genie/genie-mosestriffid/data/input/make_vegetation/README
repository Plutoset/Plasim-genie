This directory contains the code for making some (six, to be exact) of
the genie-land restart files included with the GENIE distribution.
They can all be created by running the make file with different
options.  i.e. there is no need to edit the fortran source.

The code uses the compiled genie-land and genie-lib/nc1 libraries,
which must be compiled at the same precision as the nc1 netCDF
library, as I haven't accounted for precision differences yet.

It also looks for the atmosphere model land/sea masks in the standard
places relative to this directory.

Note also that the code always produces a netCDF file with the same
filename, so you'll have to rename it to avoid it being overwritten
when you make a new restart file.

Option       Values        Description

ATMEND       igcm, embm,   Make for either IGCM or EMBM atmosphere resolution/grid
             igcm-2
DATAEND      igbp,         Uses IGBP present-day observed vegetation (inc. land-use change)
             baresoil,     Bare soil everywhere, with PFT seeding fractions and Antarctic/Greenland ice sheets
             potential     Uses ISLSCP2 pre-agricultural potential vegetation (Ramankutty & Foley, 1999)
