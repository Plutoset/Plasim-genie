This is a list of things which need to be coded up in genie...

Please add others as you think of them...
When they are completed, please move them below the asterixes...

The initials show who has posted the 'thing to do', so if you are
  interested in helping out, you know who to get in touch with.


*) Put in #ifdefs into genie.F for all modules (DJL).

*) Fully implement a standard for the units and signs of all 
     variables in genie.F, and a proper naming convention (DJL).

*) Properly test all the genie combinations for different 
     precision combinations (DJL).

*) Sort out a proper and consistent time convention throughout genie,
     with time being calculated in genie.F and then passed to modules,
     rather than each module calculating its own time separately (DJL).

*) Make the fixedseaice and fixedocean keep a track of energy and
     water so that conservation can be tested (DJL).

*) Check all the signs and magnitudes of fluxes in genie.F (DJL).

*) implement a non-integer land-sea mask in genie.F (DJL).

*) Make the restart writing/reading consistent accross the board in 
     genie (DJL).

*) Get rid of the annoying pre-timestep carried out at the
     initialisation stage, and check restarts still work (DJL).

*) Re-make the fixedatmos file for embm, now that goldstein uses mm as
     its water flux units (DJL).

*) Get rid of all hard-wiring of timestep info in modules (e.g. 600
     seconds igcm land-surface) (DJL).

*) Upgrade GOLDSTEIN modules to output monthly average
     data alongside existing output (and make it netCDF this time!)
     (AY)

*) Make sure that all the netcdf reading routines fail and stop if
     the required variable isn't found.  At present, the code just
     continues (DJL).

*) Get rid of mini-timestep hard-wiring in igcm (AY).

*) investigate synchronisation of igcm and goldstein land-sea masks (AY).

*) check interpolation routines for land-sea mask consistency (AY).

*) rationalise genie.F so that it has more common components. (AY).

*) check alignment of common blocks in igcm (DJL)

*) put in a proper energy check into goldsteinseaice (DJL)

*) put an energy check into the igcm atmosphere (DJL)

*) experiment with different mini-timesteps for the ocean in the
     ig-fi-fi case (DJL)

*) put in a T-2m and a U/V-10m diagnostic into the igcm (DJL).

*) Put output routines into genie-fixed ocean/seaice and slab
     ocean/seaice (DJL).

*) Sort out energy-checking in the slabocean when ocean fluxes 
     are non-zero (DJL).

*) Sort out restarts in the slabocean when ocean fluxes 
     are non-zero (DJL).

*) Bring together all the boundary-condition makers into a single bit
     of code (DJL).

*) Put on CVS the code used to calculate orbital coefficients (DJL).

*) Comment all the .config files so it's obvious to a new user what
     they actually do (DJL).

*) Put in a logical flag for fixing the At-Pa water transport (DJL).

*) Think about fixed SSTs versus air temperatures in the
     genie_ig_fi_fi case, and also the calibration target for
     genie_ig_sl_sl runs (DJL).

*) Test the old c-goldstein surface flux module with fixedocean and
     fixedseaice, and other combinations (DJL).

*) Remove obsolete features in genie_example.job, for example the
     land-sea mask file in the igcm (DJL).
 
*) Fully comment genie_example.job so all the namelist variables are
     explained (DJL).

*) Put in the fixedatmosphere into the testing framework (DJL).

*) Get rid of the re-writing of the zeroth restart file, as it means
 that restarts can't be repeated if there is an error (DJL).

*) Look at the output from genie-main; it looks odd in the _atm case,
 land-sea mask looks corrupted (DJL).

*) Why do fixedicesheet and fixedchem restarts have ioffset=120? (DJL).

*) Check slabocean and slabseaice restarts (DJL).

o) sort out restarts for ig_go_sl (i.e. synchronise goldstein and igcm
 restarts).

o) Make a gui to replace the clumsy make_jobs.pl, or improve
     make_jobs.pl so it's easier to use.

o) Check addition of latent heat into the igcm.

o) Collate everyone's changes which they have to make to the cvs
     version of genie to get it to run on their system, and incorporate 
     them into the cvs version if possible.

o) sort out the pressure-level igcm output onto sensible levels.

o) put a total cloud diagnostic into the igcm.

o) MSLP igcm diagnostic.

o) Put a standard set of instructions onto the genie website.

o) Put in a diagnostic for Atlantic-Pacific water transport.

o) Make sure that there is no time-drift in the genie modules...james
     A. has found a 1-day time lag in long goldstein-igcm runs.

o) Make an LGM standard job and put it into into make_jobs.pl.

o) Put boundary-condition-makers onto cvs, in genie-utilities.

o) Tidy up the energy and water conservation tests so they are easier
     to use.
