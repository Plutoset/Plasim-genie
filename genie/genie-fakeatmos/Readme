Fake Atmosphere will have an initial part and part called at each timestep

In order not to change the variables that are passed in any of the 
current routines, we highjack the variables as follows:

Will make all heat fluxes zero but put total flux in latent_ocn 
(call it fluxh in fake atmos routines).
Make evap and runoff zero and put all salt fluxes in precip_ocn
(call it fluxs in fake atmos routines).


#### At initial timestep

# add to genie-global.f90 the variables 
flag_trest, flag_srest, 4 stress files, trest, srest, fluxh, fluxs, sst, sss

## initialise fake atmos
call fake_atmos_ini (flag_trest, flag_srest, 4 stress files, trest, srest, fluxh and other heat, fluxs
and other salt fluxes, sst, sss)

-read 4 stress files,  
-set all other variables used as input in goldstein (such as sensible heat, albedo) 
to zero or other value.

if flag_trest
  read in trest
  if initial, read in sst
  if restart, read in sst from restart. (read ts(1) and convert)
else
  read in fluxh,  from ini of restart file
end if

if flag_rests
  read in srest from file
else
  read in fluxs from ini or restart file
end if
  
## now initial ocean


#### At every timestep

## call fake atmosphere
call fake_atmosphere (flag_trest, flag_srest, trest, srest, fluxh, fluxs, sst, sss)

sst = ts(1, 1:maxi, 1:maxj, kmax)
sss = ts(2, 1:maxi, 1:maxj, kmax)

if flag_trest
  fluxh = const ( trest - sst)    # maybe add some other options later. 
  
end if   # don't need else because fluxh does not change

end if flag_rests
  fluxs = const ( srest - sss)
end if

## call goldstein
